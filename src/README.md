# Assignment 2 — Selection Sort  Alikan Amanzholov

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course assignment.  
It contains a simple implementation of **Selection Sort** with performance tracking.

The tracker counts:
- **Comparisons** — number of element comparisons
- **Swaps** — number of element swaps
- **Array accesses** — number of array reads and writes

A command-line benchmark tool is included to measure runtime and operation counts on arrays of different sizes and distributions.
