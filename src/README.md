# Assignment 2 â€” Selection Sort  Alikan Amanzholov

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course assignment.  
It contains a simple implementation of **Selection Sort** with performance tracking.

The tracker counts:
- **Comparisons** â€” number of element comparisons
- **Swaps** â€” number of element swaps
- **Array accesses** â€” number of array reads and writes


A command-line benchmark tool is included to measure runtime and operation counts on arrays of different sizes and distributions.
Structure
	â€¢	src/main/java â€” source code
	â€¢	src/test/java â€” unit tests
	â€¢	docs/ â€” CSV files containing performance measurement results
